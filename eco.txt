- In the first seven plans, trade was characterized by what is called import substitution Strategy.

- This policy aimed at replacing or substituting imports with domestic production . In this policy the government protected the domestic industries from foreign competition by using 'tariffs' and quotas.

 topic-  Effect of Policies on Industrial Development: The achievements of India’s industrial sector during the first seven plans are impressive indeed.

- The  GDP contribution by the industrial sector increased from 11.8 % in 1950-51 to 24.6 % in 1990-91.

- The industrial sector became well diversified by 1990, largely due to the public sector.

- Protection from foreign competition enabled the development of indigenous industries in the areas of electronics and automobile, which otherwise could not have developed.

- The need to obtain a license to start an industry was misused by industrial houses.

- The excessive regulation of what came to be called the 'permit license raj' prevented certain firms from becoming more efficient.

- Due to problems of license Raj , government introduced new economic policy in 1991.


************* Chapter 3  *********

- Balance of payment crisis -1991. In the late 1980s, government expenditure began to exceed its revenue.

- India took loan of 7 billion dollar from IMF and agreed to the conditionalities of World Bank and IMF and announced the New Economic Policy (NEP). 

- reforms were brought to deregulate industries by removing restrictions. Industrial licensing was abolished for almost all but product categories — alcohol,
cigarettes, hazardous chemicals, industrial explosives, electronics,aerospace and drugs and pharmaceuticals. 

- The only industries which are now reserved for the public sector are a part of defence equipment, atomic energy generation and railway transport. 

- Many goods produced by small-scale industries have now been dereserved. 

- The reform policies led to the establishment of private sector banks, Indian as well as foreign determine the prices.

-  Foreign investment limit in banks was raised to around 74 %.

- Foreign Institutional Investors (FII), such as merchant bankers, mutual funds and pension funds, are now allowed to invest in Indian financial markets.

- Tax rates were reduced.  The rate of corporation tax, which was very high earlier, has been gradually reduced.

- In 1991, as an immediate measure to resolve the BOP crisis, the rupee was devalued against foreign currencies.

- This led to an increase in the inflow of foreign exchange.

- Liberalization of trade was initiated to increase international competitiveness and promote efficiency of local industries.

- Import licensing was abolished except in case of hazardous and environmentally sensitive industries.

- Quantitative restrictions like tariffs on imports and exports were removed.

- Export duties have been removed to increase the competitive position of Indian goods in the international markets.

topic: World Trade Organization(WTO)
 - The WTO was founded in 1995 as the successor organization to the General Agreement on Trade and Tariff (GATT). 

- GATT was established in 1948 with 23 countries as the global trade organization to administer all multilateral trade agreements by providing equal opportunities to
all countries in the international market for trading purposes.

- WTO is expected to establish a rule-based trading regime in which nations cannot place arbitrary restrictions on trade.

- It facilitates international trades of good and services by removing tariffs and non tariffs barriers providing greater market access to member countries.

- India has kept its commitments towards liberalization of trade, made in the WTO, by removing quantitative restrictions on imports and reducing tariff rates.

- The opening of the economy has led to a rapid increase in FDI and  Foreign Exchange reserves.

-  FDI and  (FII), has increased from about US $100 million in 1990-91 to US $ 73.5 billion in 2014-15.

- There has been an increase in the foreign exchange reserves from about US $ 6 billion in 1990-91 to about US $ 321 billion in 2014-15. It recently touched 700 Billion dollar in 2024.

- USA has not removed their quota restriction on import of textiles from India and China.

- Siricilla Tragedy : Power tariff hike as part of liberalization, privatization, and globalization lead to shutdown of Powerloom industry due to which 50 weavers committed suicide.


************* Chapter 4 Poverty  *********

- Amartya Sen, noted Nobel Laureate, has developed an index known as Sen Index to measure poverty.

- There are other tools such as Poverty Gap Index and Squared Poverty Gap.

- When the number of poor is estimated as the proportion of people below the poverty line, it is known as ‘Head Count Ratio’.
 
- In terms of proportion, in 1973-74, about 55 per cent of the total population was below the poverty line. In 2011-12, it has fallen to 22 per cent.

- The Green Revolution exacerbated the disparities regionally and between large and small farmers.

- Poverty alleviation programmes like 'Food for work' approach has been initiated from the Third 5 Year Plan (1961-66).

- MNREGA act was passed in 2005. 100 days employment guarantee by government.

- Poverty Line Basket: The basket of goods and services necessary to satisfy basic human needs is the Poverty Line Basket (PLB).

- Poverty Line Calculation: Poverty estimation in India is now carried out by NITI Aayog’s task force through the calculation of poverty line based on the data captured by the NSSO under the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MOSPI).

topic: Poverty Estimation of India:

- Reference Period: It is the duration/period during which the survey is conducted by NSSO workers in which they ask certain questions to households.

- Uniform Resource Period (URP): until 1993-94, the poverty line was based on URP data, which involved asking people about their consumption expenditure across a 30-day recall period, the information was based on the recall of consumption expenditure in the previous 30 days.

- Mixed Reference Period (MRP): From 1999-2000 onwards, the NSSO switched to an MRP method which measures consumption of five low-frequency items (clothing, footwear, durables, education and institutional health expenditure) over the previous year, and all other items over the previous 30 days.

* Modified Mixed Reference period: 365 days for five low frequency items 
- 7 days for edible items , vegetables , fruits

- 30 days for remaining items. fuel and light.


* National Planning Committee’s (1938) poverty line (ranging from ₹15 to ₹20 per capita per month) was also based on a minimum standard of living perspective in which nutritional requirements were implicit.

* The Bombay Plan (1944) proponents had suggested a poverty line of ₹75 per capita per year.

* Planning Commission Expert Group (1962), working group constituted by the Planning Commission formulated the separate poverty lines for rural and urban areas (₹20 and ₹25 per capita per year respectively).

* VM Dandekar and N Rath (1971), made the first systematic assessment of poverty in India, based on National Sample Survey (NSS) data.

-  VM Dandekar and N Rath were of the view that poverty line must be derived from the expenditure that was adequate to provide 2250 calories per day in both rural and urban areas.

*Alagh Committee (1979): Task force constituted by the Planning Commission under the chairmanship of YK Alagh, constructed a poverty line for rural and urban areas on the basis of nutritional requirements and related consumption expenditure.

*Lakdawala Committee (1993): Consumption expenditure should be calculated based on calorie consumption as earlier.

- State specific poverty lines should be constructed and these should be updated using the CPI-Industrial Workers in urban areas and CPI-Agriculture in rural areas.

* Tendulkar Committee (2009)
- Shift from Calorie Consumption based Poverty Estimation
- Uniform Poverty line Basket
- ₹446.68 per capita per month in rural areas
- ₹578.80 per capita per month in urban areas

* C Rangrajan committee : The Rangarajan Committee was formed in 2012 by the Government of India to estimate poverty levels in the country.

- Poverty Threshold: Persons spending below ₹47 a day in cities and ₹32 in villages be considered poor.

- Calories: 2090 kcal in urban areas and 2155 Kcal in rural areas.

- Used Modified Mixed reference period (MMRP)



************** Chapter 5 Human Capital ************

- The term human capital refers to the economic value of a worker's experience and skills.

- Human capital includes assets like education, training, intelligence, skills, health, and other things employers value such as loyalty and punctuality.

- The two major sources of human capital in a country are education and health.

- Expenditure incurred for acquiring information relating to the labour market and other markets is also a source of human capital formation.

- Physical capital is tangible and can be easily sold in the market.

- Human capital is intangible; it is endogenously built in the body and mind of its owner.

- Human capital is not sold in the market; only the services of the human capital are sold.

- The physical capital is separable from its owner, whereas, human capital is inseparable from its owner.

- Human capital benefits not only the owner but also the society in general. This is called external benefit.

- Human capital creates both private and social benefits, whereas physical capital creates only private benefit. As in, benefits from a capital good flow to those
who pay the price for the product and services produced by it.

- Human capital considers education and health as a means to increase labour productivity.

- Human capital treats human beings as a means to an end, the end being the increase in productivity.

- Human development is based on the idea that education and health are integral to human well-being.

- In the human development perspective, human beings are ends in themselves.

- During 1952-2014, education expenditure increased from 7.92% to 15.7% of total government expenditure  and as percentage of GDP increased from 0.64% to 4.13%.

- Elementary education takes a major share of total education expenditure.

- Higher/tertiary education (colleges, polytechnics and universities) share is the least.

- 50 years ago Education Commission (1964–66) had recommended that at least 6 per cent of GDP be spent on education so as to make a noticeable rate of growth in educational achievements.

- Tapas Majumdar Committee related to expenditure on education.

- In 2009, the GOI  enacted the Right of Education Act to make free education a fundamental right of all children in the age group of 6-14 years and came into effect in 2010.

- Poultry accounts for the largest share with 58 %.

- Milk production in the country has increased by more than eight times between 1951-2014.

- This can be attributed mainly to the successful implementation of ‘Operation Flood’.

- fish production from inland sources contributes about 64 % to the total value of fish production and the balance 36 % comes from the marine sector (sea and oceans).

- Horticulture sector contributes nearly one-third of the value of agriculture output and 6 % of GDP of india.

-  India is 2nd largest producer of fruits and vegetables.

- In October, 2014, The Government of India introduced a new scheme called Saansad Adarsh Gram Yojana (SAGY).

- Central Institute for Cotton Research - Nagpur

************** Chapter 7 Employment  ************

- Those activities which contribute to the gross national product are called economic activities.

- During 2011-12, India had about a 473 million strong workforce.
 
- Worker to population ratio in urban areas is about 36 whereas in rural India, the ratio is about 40.

- self-employment is a major source of livelihood for both men and women as this category accounts for more than 50 % of the workforce.

- Casual wage work is the second major source for both men and women.

- There are two types of infrastructure economic and social.

- There are commercial and non-commercial sources of energy. 

- Commercial sources are coal, petroleum and electricity as they are bought and sold.

- Non-commercial sources of energy are firewood, agricultural waste and dried dung. 

- These are noncommercial as they are found in nature/forests. Noncommercial sources are generally renewable.

- Commercial sources of energy are generally exhaustible (with the exception of hydropower)

- Both commercial and non-commercial sources of energy are known as conventional sources of energy.

- Non-conventional sources — solar energy, wind energy and tidal power.

- The growth rate of demand for power is generally higher than the GDP growth rate.

************** Chapter 9 Sustainable development  ************

- The 'Kyoto Protocol' was created to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from developed countries. Proclaimed in 1997 came into effect in 2005, ratified by 141 nations.

****************************** Geography  ****************************


--------------------chapter 1 -------------------------


- Physical geography- Geomorphology , Climatology , Hydrology , Soil Geography

- Geomorphology is devoted to the study of landforms, their evolution and related processes.

- Human Geography - Social/Cultural Geography , Population and Settlement Geography , Economic Geography , Historical Geography , Political Geography , 

- The interface between physical geography and human geography has lead to the development of Biogeography.

- Biogeography included i) Plant Geography ii) Zoo Geography iii) Ecology /Ecosystem iv) Environmental Geography

- Soils are formed through the process of pedogenesis.

- Geography is a discipline of synthesis. It attempts spatial synthesis, and history attempts temporal synthesis.

- Life on the earth appeared around 3.8 billion years before the present.

- 'Eons' are the longest period of time on the geologic time scale, lasting billions of years. 

- Era: A period of time that lasts hundreds of millions of years. Eras are made up of two or more periods. 

- Period: A period of time that is part of an era. 

- Epoch: A period of time that is usually tens of millions of years long. 

------------------- Chapter 3 Interiors of the Earth  -------------

- Why does the earth shake? The release of energy occurs along a fault.

- A fault is a sharp break in the crustal rocks. Rocks along a fault tend to move in opposite direction.

- As the overlying rock strata press them, the friction locks them together. But, their tendency to move apart at some point of time overcomes the friction.

- As a result, the blocks get deformed and eventually, they slide past one another abruptly.

- This causes a release of energy, and the energy waves travel in all directions.

- The point where the energy is released is called the focus of an earthquake or hypocenter.

- The point on the surface, nearest to the focus, is called epicentre.

- Lithosphere refers to the portion of depth up to 200 km from the surface of the earth.

- Earthquake waves are basically of two types — body waves and surface waves. 

- Body waves are generated due to the release of energy at the focus and move in all directions travelling through the body of the earth.

- The body waves interact with the surface rocks and generate new set of waves called surface waves. These waves move along the surface.

- There are two types of body waves. They are called P(primary) and S(secondary)-waves.

- P-waves move faster and are the first to arrive at the surface, they are similar to sound waves(longitudinal). They travel through gaseous, liquid and solid materials.

- S-waves arrive at the surface with some time lag, they can travel only through solid materials. (Transversal)

- The body waves interact with the surface rocks and generate new set of waves called surface waves.(Transversal)

- The surface waves are the last to report on seismograph.

- Surface waves are considered to be the most damaging waves.

- Some specific areas where the waves are not reported. Such a zone is called the ‘shadow zone’.

- It was observed that seismographs located at any distance within 105°  from the epicentre, recorded the arrival of both P and S-waves

- However, the seismographs located beyond 145°  from epicentre, record the arrival of P-waves, but not that of S-waves.

- Thus, a zone between 105°  and 145°  from epicentre was identified as the shadow zone for both the types of waves.

- The entire zone beyond 105°  does not receive S-waves.

* Types of Earthquake: i) Techtonic Earthquake ii) volcanic earthquake

iii) Collapse earthquakes: Due to intense mining activity, sometimes the roofs of underground mines collapse causing minor tremors.

iv) explosion earthquakes   v) Reservoir induced earthquakes 



- The earthquake events are scaled either according to the magnitude or intensity of the shock.

- The magnitude scale is known as the Richter scale(0-10 scale). The magnitude relates to the energy released during the quake.

- The intensity scale is named after Mercalli, an Italian seismologist.

- The intensity scale takes into account the visible damage caused by the event. The range of intensity scale is from 1-12.

- The effect of tsunami would occur only if the epicenter of the tremor is below oceanic waters and the magnitude is sufficiently high. 

* The Mantle : The portion of the interior beyond the crust is called the mantle.

- The mantle extends from Moho’s discontinuity to a depth of 2,900 km.

- The upper portion of the mantle is called asthenosphere. The word astheno means weak. It is considered to be extending upto 400 km.

- It is the main source of magma that ejects out of volcanic eruption.

- The crust and the uppermost part of the mantle are called lithosphere. Its thickness ranges from 10-200 km. 

- The lower mantle extends beyond the asthenosphere. It is in solid state.

* The Core: The earthquake wave velocities helped in understanding the existence of the core of the earth.

- The core  mantle boundary is located at the depth of 2,900 km.

- The outer core is in liquid state while the inner core is in solid state.

- The density of material at the mantle core boundary is around 5 g/cm3  and at the centre of the earth at 6,300 km, the density value is around 13g/cm3

- The core is made up of very heavy material mostly constituted by nickel and iron. It is sometimes referred to as the 'nife' layer.

* VOLCANOES AND VOLCANIC LANDFORMS:

- The layer below the solid crust is mantle. It has higher density than that of the crust.

- The mantle contains a weaker zone called asthenosphere. from this zone molten rock materials find their way to the surface.

- The material in the upper mantle portion is called magma.

- Once it starts moving towards the crust or it reaches the surface, it is referred to as lava.

- The material that reaches the ground includes lava flows, pyroclastic debris, volcanic bombs, ash and dust and gases such as nitrogen compounds, sulphur compounds and minor amounts of chlorine, hydrogen and argon.

* Types of volcanos: Volcanoes are classified on the basis of nature of eruption and the form developed at the surface.
 Major types of volcanoes are 

i) Shield Volcanoes : Except the basalt flows, the shield volcanoes are the largest of all the volcanoes on the earth.

- The Hawaiian volcanoes are the most famous shield volcanos.

- These volcanoes are mostly made up of basalt, a type of lava that is very fluid when erupted. For this reason, these volcanoes are not steep.

- They become explosive if somehow water gets into the vent; otherwise, they are characterized by low-explosivity.

ii) Composite Volcanoes (Stratovolcano) : These volcanoes are characterized by eruptions of cooler and more viscous lavas than basalt.

- These volcanoes often result in explosive eruptions. They are common type of volcanoes.

- Along with lava, large quantities of pyroclastic material and ashes find their way to the ground.

iii) Caldera : These are the most explosive of the earth’s volcanoes.

- They are usually so explosive that when they erupt they tend to collapse on themselves rather than building any tall structure.

- The collapsed depressions are called calderas. They are very rare


iv) Flood Basalt Provinces : These volcanoes outpour highly fluid lava that flows for long distances.

- Some parts of the world are covered by thousands of sq. km of thick basalt lava flows. thickness can be as much as 50 m.

- The Deccan Traps from India, presently covering most of the Maharashtra plateau, are a much larger flood basalt province.

- They are extremely rare occurred only 20 times in earth history.

v) Mid-Ocean Ridge Volcanoes :These volcanoes occur in the oceanic areas.

- There is a system of mid-ocean ridges more than 70,000 km long that stretches through all the ocean basins. The central portion of this bridge experiences frequent eruptions.


* VOLCANIC LANDFORMS: The lava that is released during volcanic eruptions on cooling develops into igneous rocks.

- The cooling may take place either on reaching the surface or also while the lava is still in the crustal portion.

- Depending on the location of the cooling of the lava, igneous rocks are classified as volcanic rocks (cooling at the surface) and plutonic rocks (cooling in the
crust).

- The lava that cools within the crustal portions assumes different forms. These forms are called intrusive forms.
 

* Batholiths: A large body of magmatic material that cools in the deeper depth of the crust develops in the form of large domes.
- They appear on the surface only after the denudational processes remove the overlying materials.

- They cover large areas, and at times, assume depth that may be several km.

- These are granitic bodies. Batholiths are the cooled portion of magma chambers.

* Lacoliths: These are large dome-shaped intrusive bodies with a level base and connected by a pipe-like conduit from below.

- It can be regarded as the localized source of lava that finds its way to the surface.

- The Karnataka plateau is spotted with domal hills of granite rocks.

* Lapolith: As and when the lava moves upwards, a portion of the same may tend to move in a horizontal direction wherever it finds a weak plane.

- It may get rested in different forms. In case it develops into a saucer shape, concave to the sky body, it is called lapolith.

* Phacolith: A wavy mass of intrusive rocks, at times, is found at the base of synclines or at the top of anticline in folded igneous country.

- Such wavy materials have a definite conduit to source beneath in the form of magma chambers (subsequently developed as batholiths). These are called the phacoliths.


* Sills: The near horizontal bodies of the intrusive igneous rocks are called sill or sheet, depending on the thickness of the material. The thinner ones are called sheets while the thick horizontal deposits are called sills.


* Dykes :When the lava makes its way through cracks and the fissures developed in the land, it solidifies almost perpendicular to the ground.

- It gets cooled in the same position to develop a wall-like structure. Such structures are called dykes. 

-These are the most commonly found intrusive forms in the western Maharashtra area.

- These are considered the feeders for the eruptions that led to the development of the Deccan traps.


------------------- Chapter 4 DISTRIBUTION OF OCEANS AND CONTINENTS  -------------

- 29% continents , 30% oceans

- Alfred Wegener—a German meteorologist, put forth a comprehensive argument in the form of “the continental drift theory” in 1912.

- According to Wegener, all the continents formed a single continental mass and mega ocean surrounded the same.

- The super continent was named PANGAEA, which meant all earth. The mega-ocean was called 'PANTHALASSA'.

- Pangaea first broke into two large continental masses as Laurasia and Gondwanaland forming the northern and southern components respectively.

- Subsequently, Laurasia and Gondwanaland continued to break into various smaller continents that exist today.


* Evidence in Support of the Continental Drift

- The Matching of Continents (Jig-Saw-Fit): The shorelines of Africa and South America facing each other have a remarkable and unmistakable match

- Map produced using a computer programme to find the best fit of the Atlantic margin was presented by Bullard in 1964.

- Rocks of Same Age Across the Oceans


* Tillite : It is the sedimentary rock formed out of deposits of glaciers.

- At the base of Gondwana system has thick tillite indicating extensive and prolonged glaciation. 

- this succession are found in Africa, Falkland Island, Madagascar, Antarctica and Australia further solidifying  the idea of all these landmass part of one large continent.

* Placer Deposits : The occurrence of rich placer deposits of gold in the Ghana coast and the absolute absence of source rock in the region is an amazing fact.

- The gold bearing veins are in Brazil and it is obvious that the gold deposits of the Ghana are derived from the Brazil plateau when the two continents lay side by side.

- Distribution of Fossils : identical species of plants and animals adapted to living on land or in fresh water are found on either side of the marine barriers

* Force for Drifting : Wegener suggested that the movement responsible for the drifting of the continents was caused by pole-fleeing force and tidal force.

- The polar-fleeing force relates to the rotation of the earth.

- Tidal force was due to gravitational pull of sun and moon.

* Convectional Current Theory : Arthur Holmes in 1930s discussed the possibility of convection currents operating in the mantle portion.

- These currents are generated due to radioactive elements causing thermal differences in the mantle portion.

- Due to these convections current continents got separated. 

- Arthur Holmes was first one to use radioactive dating to determine ages of rocks and minerals.


-The ocean floor may be segmented into 3 major divisions based on the depth as well as the forms of relief. These divisions are

i) Continental margins - continental shelf ,continental slope ,continental rise and deep-ocean trench

ii) Deep sea basins - Abyssal plains , a vast plain between continental margins and mic ocean ridges.
 
iii) Mid-ocean ridges - This forms an interconnected chain of mountain system within the ocean.

- Longest mountain chain on earth but submerged in water.

- The mid-ocean ridge is the longest mountain range on Earth, stretching for about 40,390 miles (65,000 kilometers), submerged in water. 

- Andes mountain range is largest mountain range in world with length around 9000 km.

* Sea floor spreading: The idea of seafloor spreading was proposed by Harry Hess in 1960s.

- The concept of sea-floor spreading is a geological process that explains how new oceanic crust is created at mid-ocean ridges and gradually moves away, leading to the expansion of the ocean floor.

- This theory is a key part of the broader theory of plate tectonics.

- The ocean crust rocks are much younger than the continental rocks.

* Plate Tectonics: This theory was first purposed by McKenzie , Parker and  Morgan.

- A tectonic plate (also called lithospheric plate) is a massive, irregularly-shaped slab of solid rock, consisted of both continental and oceanic crust.

- Plates move horizontally over the asthenosphere as rigid units

- Pacific plate is largely an oceanic plate whereas the Eurasian plate may be called a continental plate.

- The theory of plate tectonics proposes that the earth’s lithosphere is divided into seven major and some minor plates.

- Major plates : i) Antarctica and the surrounding oceanic plate
ii) North American plate         iii) South American plate
iv) Pacific plate                 v) India-Australia-New Zealand plate

vi) Africa with the eastern Atlantic floor plate  vii) Eurasia and the adjacent oceanic plate.

- Minor plates: i) Cocos plate : Between Central America and Pacific plate

ii) Nazca plate : Between South America and Pacific plate

iii) Arabian plate : Mostly the Saudi Arabian landmass

iv) Philippine plate : Between the Asiatic and Pacific plate

v) Caroline plate : Between the Philippine and Indian plate (North of New Guinea)

vi) Fuji plate : North-east of Australia

vii) The Juan de Fuca plate is a tectonic plate that is subducting beneath the North American plate. It's located off the western coast of North America.

* There are 3 types of plate boundaries

i) Divergent Boundaries: Where new crust is generated as the plates pull away from each other

- The sites where the plates move away from each other are called spreading sites.

- The best-known example of divergent boundaries is the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. Here, the American Plate(s) is/are separated from the Eurasian and African Plates.

ii) Convergent Boundaries: Where the crust is destroyed as one plate dived under another

- The location where sinking of a plate occurs is called a subduction zone.

- There are 3 ways in which convergence can occur. These are: a) between an oceanic and continental plate;

b) between two oceanic plates  and c) between two continental plates.

- Trenches and mountains are formed due to this.

iii) Transform Boundaries : Where the crust is neither produced nor destroyed as the plates slide horizontally past each other.

- Transform faults are the planes of separation generally perpendicular to the mid-oceanic ridges.

- No eruption , Earthquake prone area

- There is a differential movement of a portion of the plate away from the axis of the earth.

* Rates of Plate Movement : The Arctic Ridge has the slowest rate (less than 2.5 cm/yr).

- East Pacific Rise near Easter Island, in the South Pacific about 3,400 km west of Chile, has the fastest rate (more than 15 cm/yr).

-  Heat within the earth comes from two main sources: radioactive decay and residual heat.

* Indian Plate: The Indian plate includes Peninsular India and the Australian continental portions.

- The eastern margin is a spreading site lying to the east of Australia in the form of an oceanic ridge in SW Pacific.

- The Western margin follows Kirthar Mountain of Pakistan.

- The boundary between India and the Antarctic plate is also marked by oceanic ridge (divergent boundary).

- India was a large island situated off the Australian coast, in a vast ocean.

- The Tethys Sea separated it from the Asian continent till about 225 million years ago.

- About 98% of the total crust of the earth is composed of 8 elements like oxygen, silicon, aluminum, iron, calcium, sodium, potassium and magnesium.

- rest is constituted by titanium, hydrogen, phosphorous, manganese, sulphur, carbon, nickel and other elements.

- malachite - copper ore

* Physical characteristic of Minerals

i) External crystal form  ii) Cleavage iii) Fracture iv) Luster v) Color

vi) Streak vii) Transparency viii) Structure

ix) Hardness: degree of hardness measured from 1-10.

- They are: 1. talc; 2. gypsum; 3. calcite 4. fluorite 5. apatite 6. feldspar 7. quartz; 8. topaz; 9. corundum; 10. diamond.

x) Specific gravity

- Petrology is science of rocks.

- There are 3 types of rocks

i) Igneous:  solidified from magma and lava from interior of earth hence called primary rocks.

- Granite, gabbro, pegmatite, basalt, volcanic breccia and tuff are some of the examples of igneous rocks.

ii) Sedimentary rocks:  the result of deposition of fragments of rocks by exogenous processes

- In many sedimentary rocks, the layers of deposits retain their characteristics even after lithification.

- Hence, we see a number of layers of varying thickness in sedimentary rocks like sandstone, shale etc.

- Depending upon the mode of formation, sedimentary rocks are classified into 3 major groups: 

a) mechanically formed — sandstone, conglomerate, limestone, shale, loess , Tillite , borax , breccia etc. 

b) organically formed — geyserite, chalk, limestone, coal etc.

c) chemically formed —chert, limestone, halite, potash etc.

iii) Metamorphic Rocks: formed out of existing rocks undergoing recrystallisation.

- The word metamorphic means ‘change of form’.

- These rocks form under the action of pressure, volume and temperature (PVT) changes.

- Metamorphism is a process by which already consolidated rocks undergo recrystallisation and reorganization of materials within original rock.

- dynamic metamorphism: No chemical change

- thermal metamorphism : Chemical change occurs

- There are 2 types of thermal metamorphism — contact metamorphism and regional metamorphism.


- Metamorphic rocks are classified into 2 major groups — foliated rocks and non-foliated rocks.

- Gneissoid, granite, syenite, slate, schist, marble, quartzite etc. are some examples of metamorphic rocks.

* ROCK CYCLE

- Rocks do not remain in one form for long but may undergo transform.

- Rock cycle is continuous process through which old rocks are transformed into new ones.

- igneous rocks are primary rocks and other rocks (sedimentary and metamorphic) form from these primary rocks.

- Igneous rocks can be changed into metamorphic rocks.

- The fragments derived out of igneous and metamorphic rocks form into sedimentary rocks.

- The crustal rocks (igneous, metamorphic and sedimentary) once formed may be carried down into the mantle (interior of the earth) through subduction process  of plate convergence

- the same melt down due to increase in temperature in the interior and turn into molten magma, the original source for igneous rocks. Thus cycle keeps going.


------------------- Chapter 6 Geomorphic process    --------------------------------------------

-  The earth’s surface is being continuously subjected to by external forces originating within the earth’s atmosphere and by internal forces originated from within the earth

- The external forces are known as exogenic forces.

- The internal forces are known as endogenic forces.

- The actions of exogenic forces results in degradation of relief/elevations and filling up(aggradation) of basins/depressions, on the earth’s surface. This overall process is known as gradation.

- The endogenic and exogenic forces causing physical stresses and chemical actions on earth materials and bringing about changes in the configuration of the surface of the earth are known as geomorphic processes.

- Diastrophism and volcanism are endogenic geomorphic processes.

- Weathering, mass wasting, erosion and deposition are exogenic geomorphic processes.

- Any exogenic element of nature (like water, ice, wind, etc.,) capable of acquiring and transporting earth materials can be called a geomorphic agent.

* Endogenic Processes:

- The energy emanating from within the earth is the main force behind endogenic geomorphic processes.

- This energy is mostly generated by radioactivity, rotational and tidal friction and primordial heat from the origin of the earth.

- This energy due to geothermal gradients and heat flow from within induces diastrophism and volcanism in the lithosphere.

* Diastrophism : All processes that move, elevate or build up portions of the earth’s crust come under diastrophism.

- Diastrophism involves crustal deformation without magma eruption.

They include: 
i) Orogenic processes involving mountain building through severe folding and affecting long and narrow belts of the earth’s crust

ii) Epeirogenic processes involving uplift or warping of large parts of the earth’s crust; 

iii) earthquakes involving local relatively minor movements

iv) plate tectonics involving horizontal movements of crustal plates.

* Difference between Orogenic and Epeirogenic

- In the process of orogeny, the crust is severely deformed into folds.

- Due to epeirogeny, there may be simple deformation.

- Orogeny is a mountain building process whereas epeirogeny is continental building process.

- Through the processes of orogeny, epeirogeny, earthquakes and plate tectonics, there can be faulting and fracturing of the crust.

- All these processes cause pressure, volume and temperature (PVT) changes which in turn induce metamorphism of rocks.

* EXOGENIC PROCESSES

- Temperature and precipitation are the two important climatic elements that control various processes.

- All the exogenic geomorphic processes are covered under a general term, 'denudation'.

- The effects of most of the exogenic geomorphic processes are small and slow and may be imperceptible in a short time span, but will in the long run affect the rocks
severely due to continued fatigue.

* WEATHERING : Weathering is defined as mechanical disintegration and chemical decomposition of rocks through the actions of various elements of weather and climate.

i) Chemical Weathering process

ii) Physical Weathering Processes : (a) gravitational forces , , load and shearing stress

b) Thermal Expasion forces due to temperature changes, crystal growth or animal activity

c) water pressures controlled by wetting and drying cycles

iii) Biological activity and weathering
