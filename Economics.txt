- In the first seven plans, trade was characterized by what is called import substitution Strategy.

- This policy aimed at replacing or substituting imports with domestic production . In this policy the government protected the domestic industries from foreign competition by using 'tariffs' and quotas.

 topic-  Effect of Policies on Industrial Development: The achievements of India’s industrial sector during the first seven plans are impressive indeed.

- The  GDP contribution by the industrial sector increased from 11.8 % in 1950-51 to 24.6 % in 1990-91.

- The industrial sector became well diversified by 1990, largely due to the public sector.

- Protection from foreign competition enabled the development of indigenous industries in the areas of electronics and automobile, which otherwise could not have developed.

- The need to obtain a license to start an industry was misused by industrial houses.

- The excessive regulation of what came to be called the 'permit license raj' prevented certain firms from becoming more efficient.

- Due to problems of license Raj , government introduced new economic policy in 1991.


************* Chapter 3  *********

- Balance of payment crisis -1991. In the late 1980s, government expenditure began to exceed its revenue.

- India took loan of 7 billion dollar from IMF and agreed to the conditionalities of World Bank and IMF and announced the New Economic Policy (NEP). 

- reforms were brought to deregulate industries by removing restrictions. Industrial licensing was abolished for almost all but product categories — alcohol,
cigarettes, hazardous chemicals, industrial explosives, electronics,aerospace and drugs and pharmaceuticals. 

- The only industries which are now reserved for the public sector are a part of defence equipment, atomic energy generation and railway transport. 

- Many goods produced by small-scale industries have now been dereserved. 

- The reform policies led to the establishment of private sector banks, Indian as well as foreign determine the prices.

-  Foreign investment limit in banks was raised to around 74 %.

- Foreign Institutional Investors (FII), such as merchant bankers, mutual funds and pension funds, are now allowed to invest in Indian financial markets.

- Tax rates were reduced.  The rate of corporation tax, which was very high earlier, has been gradually reduced.

- In 1991, as an immediate measure to resolve the BOP crisis, the rupee was devalued against foreign currencies.

- This led to an increase in the inflow of foreign exchange.

- Liberalization of trade was initiated to increase international competitiveness and promote efficiency of local industries.

- Import licensing was abolished except in case of hazardous and environmentally sensitive industries.

- Quantitative restrictions like tariffs on imports and exports were removed.

- Export duties have been removed to increase the competitive position of Indian goods in the international markets.

topic: World Trade Organization(WTO)
 - The WTO was founded in 1995 as the successor organization to the General Agreement on Trade and Tariff (GATT). 

- GATT was established in 1948 with 23 countries as the global trade organization to administer all multilateral trade agreements by providing equal opportunities to
all countries in the international market for trading purposes.

- WTO is expected to establish a rule-based trading regime in which nations cannot place arbitrary restrictions on trade.

- It facilitates international trades of good and services by removing tariffs and non tariffs barriers providing greater market access to member countries.

- India has kept its commitments towards liberalization of trade, made in the WTO, by removing quantitative restrictions on imports and reducing tariff rates.

- The opening of the economy has led to a rapid increase in FDI and  Foreign Exchange reserves.

-  FDI and  (FII), has increased from about US $100 million in 1990-91 to US $ 73.5 billion in 2014-15.

- There has been an increase in the foreign exchange reserves from about US $ 6 billion in 1990-91 to about US $ 321 billion in 2014-15. It recently touched 700 Billion dollar in 2024.

- USA has not removed their quota restriction on import of textiles from India and China.

- Siricilla Tragedy : Power tariff hike as part of liberalization, privatization, and globalization lead to shutdown of Powerloom industry due to which 50 weavers committed suicide.


************* Chapter 4 Poverty  *********

- Amartya Sen, noted Nobel Laureate, has developed an index known as Sen Index to measure poverty.

- There are other tools such as Poverty Gap Index and Squared Poverty Gap.

- When the number of poor is estimated as the proportion of people below the poverty line, it is known as ‘Head Count Ratio’.
 
- In terms of proportion, in 1973-74, about 55 per cent of the total population was below the poverty line. In 2011-12, it has fallen to 22 per cent.

- The Green Revolution exacerbated the disparities regionally and between large and small farmers.

- Poverty alleviation programmes like 'Food for work' approach has been initiated from the Third 5 Year Plan (1961-66).

- MNREGA act was passed in 2005. 100 days employment guarantee by government.

- Poverty Line Basket: The basket of goods and services necessary to satisfy basic human needs is the Poverty Line Basket (PLB).

- Poverty Line Calculation: Poverty estimation in India is now carried out by NITI Aayog’s task force through the calculation of poverty line based on the data captured by the NSSO under the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MOSPI).

topic: Poverty Estimation of India:

- Reference Period: It is the duration/period during which the survey is conducted by NSSO workers in which they ask certain questions to households.

- Uniform Resource Period (URP): until 1993-94, the poverty line was based on URP data, which involved asking people about their consumption expenditure across a 30-day recall period, the information was based on the recall of consumption expenditure in the previous 30 days.

- Mixed Reference Period (MRP): From 1999-2000 onwards, the NSSO switched to an MRP method which measures consumption of five low-frequency items (clothing, footwear, durables, education and institutional health expenditure) over the previous year, and all other items over the previous 30 days.

* Modified Mixed Reference period: 365 days for five low frequency items 
- 7 days for edible items , vegetables , fruits

- 30 days for remaining items. fuel and light.


* National Planning Committee’s (1938) poverty line (ranging from ₹15 to ₹20 per capita per month) was also based on a minimum standard of living perspective in which nutritional requirements were implicit.

* The Bombay Plan (1944) proponents had suggested a poverty line of ₹75 per capita per year.

* Planning Commission Expert Group (1962), working group constituted by the Planning Commission formulated the separate poverty lines for rural and urban areas (₹20 and ₹25 per capita per year respectively).

* VM Dandekar and N Rath (1971), made the first systematic assessment of poverty in India, based on National Sample Survey (NSS) data.

-  VM Dandekar and N Rath were of the view that poverty line must be derived from the expenditure that was adequate to provide 2250 calories per day in both rural and urban areas.

*Alagh Committee (1979): Task force constituted by the Planning Commission under the chairmanship of YK Alagh, constructed a poverty line for rural and urban areas on the basis of nutritional requirements and related consumption expenditure.

*Lakdawala Committee (1993): Consumption expenditure should be calculated based on calorie consumption as earlier.

- State specific poverty lines should be constructed and these should be updated using the CPI-Industrial Workers in urban areas and CPI-Agriculture in rural areas.

* Tendulkar Committee (2009)
- Shift from Calorie Consumption based Poverty Estimation
- Uniform Poverty line Basket
- ₹446.68 per capita per month in rural areas
- ₹578.80 per capita per month in urban areas

* C Rangrajan committee : The Rangarajan Committee was formed in 2012 by the Government of India to estimate poverty levels in the country.

- Poverty Threshold: Persons spending below ₹47 a day in cities and ₹32 in villages be considered poor.

- Calories: 2090 kcal in urban areas and 2155 Kcal in rural areas.

- Used Modified Mixed reference period (MMRP)



************** Chapter 5 Human Capital ************

- The term human capital refers to the economic value of a worker's experience and skills.

- Human capital includes assets like education, training, intelligence, skills, health, and other things employers value such as loyalty and punctuality.

- The two major sources of human capital in a country are education and health.

- Expenditure incurred for acquiring information relating to the labour market and other markets is also a source of human capital formation.

- Physical capital is tangible and can be easily sold in the market.

- Human capital is intangible; it is endogenously built in the body and mind of its owner.

- Human capital is not sold in the market; only the services of the human capital are sold.

- The physical capital is separable from its owner, whereas, human capital is inseparable from its owner.

- Human capital benefits not only the owner but also the society in general. This is called external benefit.

- Human capital creates both private and social benefits, whereas physical capital creates only private benefit. As in, benefits from a capital good flow to those
who pay the price for the product and services produced by it.

- Human capital considers education and health as a means to increase labour productivity.

- Human capital treats human beings as a means to an end, the end being the increase in productivity.

- Human development is based on the idea that education and health are integral to human well-being.

- In the human development perspective, human beings are ends in themselves.

- During 1952-2014, education expenditure increased from 7.92% to 15.7% of total government expenditure  and as percentage of GDP increased from 0.64% to 4.13%.

- Elementary education takes a major share of total education expenditure.

- Higher/tertiary education (colleges, polytechnics and universities) share is the least.

- 50 years ago Education Commission (1964–66) had recommended that at least 6 per cent of GDP be spent on education so as to make a noticeable rate of growth in educational achievements.

- Tapas Majumdar Committee related to expenditure on education.

- In 2009, the GOI  enacted the Right of Education Act to make free education a fundamental right of all children in the age group of 6-14 years and came into effect in 2010.

************** Chapter 6 Rural Development ************

- NABARD was setup in 1982 as an apex body to coordinate the activities of all institutions involved in the rural financing system.

- Apni Mandi - Punjab, Haryana and Rajasthan

- Hadaspar Mandi : Pune

- Rythu Bazars : vegetable and fruit markets in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana

- ‘Kudumbashree’ is a women-oriented community-based poverty reduction programme being implemented in Kerala.

- livestock sector alone provides alternate livelihood options to over 70 million small and marginal farmers including landless labourers

- Poultry accounts for the largest share with 58 %.

- Milk production in the country has increased by more than eight times between 1951-2014.

- This can be attributed mainly to the successful implementation of ‘Operation Flood’.

- fish production from inland sources contributes about 64 % to the total value of fish production and the balance 36 % comes from the marine sector (sea and oceans).

- Horticulture sector contributes nearly one-third of the value of agriculture output and 6 % of GDP of india.

-  India is 2nd largest producer of fruits and vegetables.

- In October, 2014, The Government of India introduced a new scheme called Saansad Adarsh Gram Yojana (SAGY).

- Central Institute for Cotton Research - Nagpur

************** Chapter 7 Employment  ************

- Those activities which contribute to the gross national product are called economic activities.

- During 2011-12, India had about a 473 million strong workforce.
 
- Worker to population ratio in urban areas is about 36 whereas in rural India, the ratio is about 40.

- self-employment is a major source of livelihood for both men and women as this category accounts for more than 50 % of the workforce.

- Casual wage work is the second major source for both men and women.

- There are two types of infrastructure economic and social.

- There are commercial and non-commercial sources of energy. 

- Commercial sources are coal, petroleum and electricity as they are bought and sold.

- Non-commercial sources of energy are firewood, agricultural waste and dried dung. 

- These are noncommercial as they are found in nature/forests. Noncommercial sources are generally renewable.

- Commercial sources of energy are generally exhaustible (with the exception of hydropower)

- Both commercial and non-commercial sources of energy are known as conventional sources of energy.

- Non-conventional sources — solar energy, wind energy and tidal power.

- The growth rate of demand for power is generally higher than the GDP growth rate.

************** Chapter 9 Sustainable development  ************

- The 'Kyoto Protocol' was created to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from developed countries. Proclaimed in 1997 came into effect in 2005, ratified by 141 nations. 
 

- The 'Montreal Protocol' is an international agreement that protects the Earth's ozone layer by phasing out the use of ozone-depleting substances (ODS).

-  Chipko Andolan in Karnataka took name ‘Appiko’.

- What is sustainable development? ‘Development that meets the need of the present generation without compromising the ability of the future generation to meet their own needs.

- The Brundtland Commission emphasizes on protecting the future generation. 

- People’s Republic of China was established in 1949. China announced its First Five Year Plan in 1953. 

- The Great Leap Forward (GLF) campaign initiated in 1958 aimed at industrializing the country on a massive scale.

- reforms were initiated in China in 1978, Pakistan in 1988 and India in 1991.

* Cash Management Bill

- Cash Management Bill (CMB) is a short-term financial instrument issued to meet the temporary cash flow of the government.

- The Government of India, in consultation with the Reserve Bank of India, issues CMBs. 

- In India, the first CMBs were issued in 2010 in order to supplement short-term cash-raising instruments such as treasury bills and ways and means advances.

- The maturity profile of CMBs is 91 days.

- The CMBs have the generic character of T-bills. Like T-bills, they are also issued at a discount and redeemed at face value at maturity.

- CMBs qualify as SLR securities. Under Section 24 of the Banking Regulation Act of 1949, investment in CMBs is also recognized as an eligible investment in government securities by banks for SLR purposes.

- The tenure, notified amount and date of issue of the CMBs depends upon the temporary cash requirement of the Government.

* Ways and Means Advance

- The WMA scheme was introduced in 1997.

- The government can avail immediate cash from the RBI, if required. But it has to return the amount within 90 days. Interest is charged at the existing repo rate.

- If the WMA exceeds 90 days, it would be treated as an overdraft (the interest rate on overdrafts is 2 percentage points more than the repo rate).

- There are two types of Ways and Means Advances — normal and special.

- A Special WMA or Special Drawing Facility is provided against the collateral of the government securities held by the state.

- The interest rate for SDF is one percentage point less than the repo rate.

- After the state has exhausted the limit of SDF, it gets normal WMA.

* Prime Lending Rate- from 1973 to 2003.

- Under PLR system, each bank had the discretion to set its own benchmark interest rate, which was typically based on its cost of funds and other factors.  

- Issues: Lack of transparency and lacking standardization

* Benchmark Prime Lending Rate(BPLR)- from 2003.

- This is the rate the bank would charge to its most creditworthy customers, this would also be the minimum interest bank would charge.

- RBI fixed BPLR for banks in 2003.
- Interest rates was regularized by RBI.
 
* Base Rate 

- Interest rate below which A bank can not offer loan to its customers.
- It was introduced in 2010.

- It considers average costs of all funds with bank, cost of maintaining CRR.

- Banks can fix their own Base rate and inform RBI.

- Interest rate was de-regularized by RBI.  

* MCLR
- RBI found weak monetary policy transmission in base rate so they introduced MCLR. 

-  It considers marginal costs of funds(recent borrowings instead of overall cost of funds) with bank, cost of maintaining CRR.

- MCLR is more dynamic and changes with repo rate.

- Lending rates= MCLR + spread , spread is decided by bank.

- It lead to better monetary policy transmission that base rate but still it was not good enough.

* EBLR (External Benchmark Linked Rate, 2019):

- Now, most new loans are linked to repo rate, T-bill rate, or other external benchmarks, ensuring even faster transmission.
 
- The bank directly links loan rates to an external benchmark like the RBI Repo Rate.

- Changes immediately or within 3 months of RBI’s rate revision

* Crowding Out: Government spending replaces private investment.
- The crowding out effect occurs when increased government borrowing leads to higher interest rates, which reduces private sector investment. 

- To finance deficits (e.g., infrastructure, welfare), the government borrows money by issuing bonds.

- More borrowing increases demand for funds, leading to a rise in interest rates.

- Businesses & individuals face higher borrowing costs (higher loan interest rates).

* Crowding In: Government spending boosts private investment by increasing demand & business confidence. 

- Crowding in occurs when higher government spending leads to an increase in private sector investment, rather than reducing it.

- The government spends on infrastructure, education, healthcare, etc.

- This stimulates demand in the economy.

- Increased government activity creates opportunities for private businesses.


- In a strong economy, govt borrowing raises interest rates, reducing private investment (crowding out).

- In a weak economy(recessions, slowdown), govt spending stimulates demand, increasing private investment (crowding in).

* Fiscal Policy : It is a macro-economic policy used by the government to adjust its spending levels and tax rates to monitor a nation’s economy.

- Controlled by the Government in form of taxes , government spending

- fiscal policy is more effective against slowdowns and recessions.		


* Monetary policy : It is a macroeconomic policy used by the Central Bank to influence money supply and interest rates.

- Controlled by the Central Bank

- To influence the money supply and interest rates.

- Bank Rate, Cash Reserve Ratio, Statutory Liquidity Ratio , Repo rate etc

- more effective against demand pull inflation.

* What is Expansionary Monetary Policy?
- It is also called Accommodative Monetary Policy.

- It is also called Pumping In.

- Its primary purpose is to increase the money supply in the economy through measures such as:
a) Decreasing interest rates – It makes it less expensive for consumers to borrow money, thus increasing the money supply in the market.

b) Lowering CRR,SLR for banks – It leaves commercial banks with more money to lend to the public, thus infusing more money into the economy.

c) Purchasing government securities by central banks – The RBI buys government securities by paying cash. This means that money available in the market increases.

* What is Contractionary Monetary Policy?
- - It is also called Pumping Out.

- It is used to decrease the amount of money supply in the economy through measures such as:
a) Raising interest rates – It makes it more expensive for consumers to borrow money, thus reducing the money supply in the market.

b) Increasing the CRR, SLR for banks – It leaves commercial banks with less money to lend to the public, thus reducing the money supply in the economy.

c) Selling government bonds – The buyers of government securities pay cash to the RBI. This means that money available in the market decreases.

- It is aimed at reducing inflation.

* Monetary Policy Committee (MPC)
- The idea to set up MPC was mooted by an RBI-appointed Urjit Patel Committee.

- Section 45ZB of the amended RBI Act, 1934 provides for an empowered 6-member Monetary Policy Committee (MPC).

- The Committee is to meet at least 4 times a year.

- The Committee will have 6 members.

- The members of MPC shall hold office for a period of 4 years and shall not be eligible for re-appointment.

- The quorum for a meeting of the MPC is 4 members.

- The RBI Governor will have a casting vote in case of a tie

* Cash Reserve ratio(CRR) : CRR is the minimum percentage of a bank’s total Demand and Time Liabilities (DTL) that a Scheduled Commercial Bank is obligated to deposit with the RBI in the form of cash.

- RBI does not pay any interest on CRR deposits.

- RBI Act does not prescribe any range (ceiling or floor) for fixing CRR. Thus, RBI has the freedom to fix the CRR at any rate depending on the macroeconomic conditions.

- Current CRR rate in 2025 is 4%

* Statutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR) : SLR is the percentage of Net Demand and Time Liabilities (NDTL) that a Scheduled Commercial Bank (SCB) has to keep with itself, in the form of: a) Cash, or
 b) Gold, or
 c) SLR Securities (such as government bonds, treasury bills, and any other instrument notified by the RBI), or Any combination of the above three.

- Unlike the CRR, SLR need not be deposited with RBI.

- Current SLR rate in 2025 is 18%

- The range of SLR prescribed by the RBI is from 0 percent to 40 percent.

- If the bank fails to maintain the required SLR, then it is liable to pay penal interest at (Bank Rate + 3%) per annum above the bank rate, on the shortfall amount.

- If the shortfall continues for the next succeeding day, penal interest is to be paid at (Bank Rate + 5%).


* Liquidity Adjustment Facility (LAF)

- LAF  allows banks to borrow money from the RBI through repurchase agreements (repos) or to make loans to RBI through reverse repo agreements.

- It is aimed to aid banks in adjusting the day-to-day mismatches in liquidity.
- It comprises the following 2 sub-instruments:
a) Repo Rate : Repo Rate is the rate of interest at which the RBI provides short-term loans to SCBs against approved securities.

b) Reverse Repo Rate :It is the rate of interest at which the RBI borrows funds from the SCBs.
    - In other words, it is the rate at which SCBs park their excess funds with the RBI for a short period of time.


- Banks can participate in LAF with a minimum bid of Rs 5 crores, and beyond which the bids can be in multiples of 5 crores only.

- Collaterals are required,  SLR qouta transferable Securities/Treasury Bills, issued by the Government of India.

- Golds are not accepted as collateral for repo borrowing.

- All the SCB's and other financial institutions like Primary dealers, NBFC can borrow money through LAF.

* Marginal Standing Facility (MSF)

- MSF was introduced by the RBI in 2011 on the recommendations of the Narasimhan Committee on banking sector reforms.

- Strictly for scheduled commercial banks.

- SCBs  can avail of an overnight short-term loan of up to 1% of their Net Demand and Time Liabilities (NDTL) outstanding at the end of the second preceding fortnight, against Government Securities as collateral.

- This facility is like the penal rate at which banks can borrow money from the central bank over and above what is available to them through the LAF window.

- MSF being a penal rate, the rate of interest under MSF is 25 basis points (0.25%) above the Repo Rate.

- Amounts in multiples of ₹1 crore (with a minimum amount of ₹1 crore) can be accessed through MSF.

* Standing deposit facility(SDF): The interest rate at which the RBI absorbs excess liquidity from commercial banks without any collateral.

- Higher than the reverse repo rate, currently set at 6.25 % , it was introduced in 2022.

- It encourages banks to transfer money to the RBI and reduces the availability of funds in the market

- All participants in the Liquidity Adjustment Facility (LAF) can take part in the SDF scheme.



* Open Market Operations (OMOs): It refer to the buying and selling of government securities by RBI to regulate the short-term money supply.

- If RBI wants to induce liquidity or more funds in the system, it will buy government securities and inject funds into the system.

- On the other hand, if the RBI, wants to curb the amount of money in the system, it will sell government securities to the banks thereby reducing the amount of cash that banks have.

* Term Repos

- Since October 2013, the RBI has introduced Term Repos (of different tenors, such as 7/14/28 days), to inject liquidity over a period that is longer than overnight.

- The aim of Term Repo is to help develop an inter-bank money market, which in turn can set market-based benchmarks for the pricing of loans and deposits, and through that improve the transmission of monetary policy.

* Qualitative Tools of Monetary Policy

1. Margins Requirements(Loan to value ratio)
- Margin refers to the difference between the value of securities offered for loans and the value of loans actually granted.

- If RBI wants to control the flow of credit to a particular sector, it fixes a high margin for that sector. As a result, customers will take lesser loans for that sector.

2. Consumer Credit Regulation: 

- Credit made available by commercial banks  for the purchase of consumer durables is known as consumer credit.
- If there is excess demand for certain consumer durables leading to their high prices, the RBI reduces consumer credit by:
 a) increasing down payment, and/or
 b) reducing the number of installments of repayment of such credit.

3. Moral Suasion: Moral Suasion means persuasion and request.
RBI makes the banks adhere to the policy and directives through persuasion or pressure in order to maintain a certain level of money supply in the economy.

4.Direct Action

- The RBI takes direct action such as refusing to rediscount the bills or charging penal interest rates, etc when a commercial bank does not co-operate with the central bank in achieving its desirable objectives.

5. Credit Rationing  or Credit Ceiling

- Under this, the RBI fixes a ceiling on the amount of loans that can be granted by SCBs.

- As a result, SCBs tighten in advancing loans to the public.

6. Priority Sector Lending: RBI prescribes the banks to provide a specified portion of the bank lending to a few specific sectors like agriculture and allied activities, micro and small enterprises, poor people for housing, etc.

- Banks must allocate 40% of ANBC to priority sectors (like agriculture, MSMEs, education, housing for weaker sections, etc.).

- For small finance banks & RRBs, this target is 75% of ANBC.

- If banks fail to meet PSL targets, they must invest the shortfall in Rural Infrastructure Development Fund (RIDF) or UIDF (Urban) or buy PSL certificates.


* What is ANBC (Adjusted Net Bank Credit) : It is a key metric used by RBI to determine the PSL targets for banks.

- It represents a bank’s total credit exposure after certain adjustments.

ANBC = Net Bank Credit + Investments in Non-SLR Bonds

- Net Bank Credit (NBC) = Total loans and advances given by the bank.

- Non-SLR Bonds = Investments in bonds that are not part of the Statutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR) requirement.

- RBI also allows adjustments for:

 Bills rediscounted with RBI/NABARD (subtracted).

 Eligible long-term bonds for infrastructure lending (excluded).
 
 * Money market instruments:

- The call/notice/term money market facilitates lending and borrowing of funds between banks and entities like Primary Dealers.

- An institution which has surplus funds may lend them on an uncollateralized basis to an institution which is short of funds.

- Borrowing/Lending for 1 day is known as Call Money

- Borrowing/Lending for 2-14 days is known as Notice Money

- Borrowing/Lending for more than 14 days is known as Term Money

- The interest rates on call/notice/term money funds depend on the surplus funds available with lenders and the demand for the same which remains volatile.

- This market is governed by the Reserve Bank of India which issues guidelines for the various participants in the call/notice money market.

- The entities permitted to participate both as lender and borrower in the call/notice money market are Scheduled Commercial Banks (excluding RRBs), Co-operative Banks (other than Land Development Banks) and Primary Dealers (PDs).


* Basel Norms(Basel accords): Issued by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS)(world's oldest financial institution).

- Basel committee on banking supervision developed those basel accords.

- Basel norms set global standards for banking regulations, ensuring financial stability and risk management.


* Basel I (1988)

- Focused only on credit risk and did not cover market risk and operational risk.

- Required banks to maintain minimum CRAR of 8%.

- India adopted Basel-I guidelines in 1999.

* Basel II (2004) : Introduced 3 pillars

1. Minimum Capital Requirement – Covers credit, market, and operational risks.

2. Supervisory Review – Regulators ensure banks maintain adequate capital.

3. Market Discipline – Banks must disclose risk exposures to increase transparency.

CRAR requirement for Indian banks: 9% (higher than Basel’s 8%).

- Tier 1 capital - 4% of RWA and rest other in tier-2 capital

# Basel III (2010)

- Introduced after the 2008 financial crisis to improve risk management.

- New capital requirements: 

- Minimum CRAR: 10.5% (8 + 2.5) (including capital conservation buffer).

- Tier 1 Capital: 6% of RWA.

- Rbi mandates minimum tier-1 capital ration 9.5 % of RWA.

- Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1): 8 % of RWA.

* Liquidity norms:

- Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR)(100%) to handle short-term crises.

- LCR means Banks must hold enough high-quality liquid assets to survive 30 days of financial stress.

- Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) to ensure long-term stability.

- NSFR Ensures banks have stable funding for at least 1 year.

- Countercyclical Capital Buffer(CCCB): During period of excessive growth add capital and take out capital during distress.

- CCCB is determined and set by RBI.

- CCB(capital conservation buffer)- 2.5% of RWA

- RBI mandates Indian banks to maintain a CRAR of 9% + 2.5%(CCB) = 11.5% (higher than Basel’s 10.5%). 

- Private & foreign banks must comply with Basel III fully.

* Escrow Account : An escrow account is a financial arrangement where a third party holds funds for two or more parties involved in a transaction.

- The funds are released when certain conditions are met.
