- The address bus, data bus, and control bus are three types of buses in a computer that allow the processor to communicate with other components: 

1.Address Bus: Carries memory addresses from the processor to other components, such as primary storage and input/output devices. The address bus is unidirectional, meaning it moves in one direction. The width of the address bus determines how much memory a system can address. 

2. Data Bus: Carries the data between the processor and other components. The data bus is bidirectional, meaning it moves in two directions. 

3. Control Bus: Carries control signals from the processor to other components, and also carries the clock's pulses. The control bus is unidirectional. The control bus coordinates activity between various devices to prevent data collisions.
