- Silver mines existed in Kharagpur hills of munger district in early times.


       ********************** Chapter 5 (The Stone  Age) *******************

- Prehistoric period is divided into three sections- Stone age, Bronze age and Iron age.

- Stone age is divided into three periods, i.e. Palaeolithic Age, Mesolithic Age ,Neolithic age

* Paleolithic Age

- Lower Palaeolithic Age(5 lac BCE to 50,000 BCE) covers the greater part of the Ice Age.

- The Early Old Stone Age sites are found in the valley of river Soan or Sohan in Punjab, now in Pakistan.

- Its people used to eat fruits, birds and raw animal flesh, etc.

- The tools were usually made of hard rock.

- In Middle Palaeolithic age(50,000 BCE to 40,000 BCE) a bit change occurred in the shape of tools made of stones or bones.

- In Upper Palaeolithic age(40,000 BCE to 10000 BCE), human lived as nomadic hunter gatherers.

- Kurnool distruct in Andhra pradesh is paleolithic site.

- Animal remains have been found at Belan valley in Mirzapur , UP.(all 3 phases are found)

- Paleolithic sites are absent in the alluvial gangetic plains of indus and ganga.

- Paleolithic sites: kurnool , Belan valley , Bhimbetka , Attirampakkam in chennai

* The Mesolithic Age : Hunters and Herders

- The Upper Palaeolithic Age came to an end with the end of the Ice Age around 9000 BCE.

- Mesolithic Age was transitional stage between paleolithic and Neolithic Age. It ended with the introduction of agriculture.

- The characteristic tools of the Mesolithic Age are microliths.

- mesolithic remains are found in Langhanj in Gujarat.

- The mesolithic site Bagor in Rajasthan is very well excavated.

- Adamgarh in Madhya Pradesh and Bagor in Rajasthan provide the earliest evidence for the domestication on animals.

- The mesolithic culture continued to be important roughly form 9000 B.C. to 4000 B.C.,it paved the way for the rise of the Neolithic culture.

* Prehistoric Art
- The people of palaeolithic and mesolithic ages practised painting.

- Bhimbetka has more than 500 painted rock shelters, distributed in an area of 10 sq km.

* Neolithic age: Began from 9000 BCE.

- Neolithic age was an age of polished tool culture.

- Tool making became an important profession and a variety of polished tools were manufactured.

- They learnt the art of pottery and their pots were well made and decorated with paintings.

- They discovered the art of producing fire by the friction of stones and the wheel was also an important discovery of this age.

- Burzahom, which means 'the place of birch'. It is situated 16 km north-west of Srinagar (JK).

- The people of GufkraI ('cave of the potter5), a neolithic site 41 km south- west of Srinagar practised both agriculture and domestication of animals.

- Neolithic people in Kashmir used not only polished tools but also weapons made of bones.

- Chirand in bihar is neolithic site where bones of antlers(deer) have been found.

- The people of Burzahom used coarse grey pottery. domestic dogs were buried with their masters in their graves.

- Neolithic tools are also found in the Garo hills in Meghalaya , hills of assam, vindhyas and allahabad.

- Neolithic sites in Allahabad district are noted for the cultivation of rice in 6000 BCE.

- The Neolithic phase in south India seems to have covered the period from about 2000 BCE to about 1000 BCE.

- The people of Neolithic Age used clothes made of cotton and wool.

- Paiyampalli is an important Neolithic site in Tamilnadu.

- Utnur is an important Neolithic site in Telangana .

- The neolithic settlers in Piklihal were cattle-herders.

- Both the ash mounds and the habitation sites have been found in Piklihal.

- The neolithic people of Mehrgarh were more advanced. They produced wheat, cotton, and lived in mud-brick houses.

- Since in the neolithic phase several settlements came to be acquainted with the cultivation of cereals and the domestication of animals, they needed pots in which they could store their foodgrains. Hence pottery first appears in this phase.

- Pottery included black burnished ware , grey ware.

- Neolithic sites in Karnataka: - Maski, Brahmagiri, Hallur, Kodekal, Sanganakallu, T. Narsipur, Piklihal and Takkalakota.

- Neolithic sites: Mehrgarh(Baluchistan) , Burzahome(JnK) , Chirand , Paiyampalli , Utnur

- Jarf el Ahmar is neolithic site in Syria.


************* Chapter 6- Chalcolithic Farming Culture **************


* Chalcolithic Age:  This Age is marked by the use of copper as copper age(2500-700 BCE).

- First metal to be used was copper.

- The Harappan culture is considered as a part of Chalcolithic culture.

- But in various parts of country Chalcolithic cultures appear after the end of bronze harrapan culture.
- The Chalcolithic age is followed by Iron Age.

- The economy was based on subsistence agriculture, stock-raising, hunting and fishing.

- The Chalcolithic people slaughtered animals for food.

- Neither they milked animals for dairy products nor did they practise cultivation.

- It was the transitional stage when both bronze, copper and stone tools were used and humans started living settled life.

- The Iron Age is usually associated with the Northen Black polished ware (NBPW).

- Some of the important megalithic sites are Hallur and Maski in Karnataka, Nagarjunakonda in Andhra Pradesh and Adichchanallur in Tamil Nadu.

- In india chalcolithic phase settlements are found in south eastern rajasthan, western madhya Pradesh , western maharastra and in southern and eastern india.

* Malwa culture :

-  In western MP Malwa, kayath(near Ujjain) and Eran have been exposed.

- The Malwa culture (1700-1200 B.C.) found in Navdatoli, Eran, and Nagda is considered to be non-Harappan.

- Malwa culture sites flourished mostly on the banks of the tributaries of Narmada. 

- They knew the art of spinning and weaving because  spindle and whorls have been discovered in Malwa. 

- Navdatoli a chalcolithic site situated on the narmada river in MP.

- People of Navdatoli several pulses ,ber ,linseeds.


* Kayatha Culture

- Kayatha culture (C.2000-1880 B.C.), which is a junior contemporary of the Harappa culture.

- Earthquake is considered as a cause for the sudden end of the Kayatha culture.


* Jorwe culture:

- Jorwe culture 1400-700 BCE covered modern maharastra except Vidarbha and konkan region.

- Most extensive excavation has been done in western maharastra at Jorwe ,Nevasa ,daimabad,chandoli ,Songaon and inamgaon in puhe district, Prakash and nashik.  

- All these sites belongs to jorwe culture , named after jorwe site located on the left bank of pravara river.

- Jorwe culture was mostly rural but some of its settlements such as daimabad and inamgaon had reached the urban stage.

- Daimabad and inamgaon was large chalcolithic settlement. Inamgaon was on the bank of river ghod.

- They manufactured beads of semi precious stones such a carnelian ,steatite  an quartz crystals.

- Over 200 Jorwe sites have  been discovered so far, largest in daimabad in Godavari valley.

- Daimabad is famous for large number of recovery of bronze goods some of which were influenced by Harrapan culture.

- At inamgaon, large mud houses with oven and circular pit houses have been discovered.

- Pandu rajar dhibi in burdawan district and Mahishdal in birbhum district in WB are chalcolithic sites.

- Senuar , sonpur and taradih in bihar and Khairadih and Narhan in UP is chalcolithic sites.

- Jorwe culture is considered non harrapan.

* Ahar culture

- In south-eastern Rajasthan Ahar and other at gilund have been excavated.

- Ahar culture is placed between 2100 BCE to 1500 BCE and gilund is considered regional culture of ahar culture.

- In settlements like Ahar and gilund good number of copper has been found.

- Ahar practically did not use microlithic tools.

- They practiced metallurgy and smelting from very beginning. Old name of Ahar was tambavati.

- Metal work was one of the means of their economy.

- Rice cultivation along with wheat, barley, millet, bajra, and jawar was grown by them.

- Balathal(Udaipur rajasthan) is the most extensively studied chalcolithic site of the Ahar culture. 

- Bull figurines appearing in large numbers during the mature Ahar phase have symbolic significance.

- People of chalcolithic phase used different types of pottery, on of which is called black and red seems to have been widely prevalent in 2000 BCE.

- These pottery were occasionally painted with white linear design.

- They domesticated animals and practiced agriculture.

- They kept cows ,sheep ,goats ,buffaloes ,pigs and deer, but they were not familiar with horse.


- Chalcolithic people generally were not familiar with burnt bricks

- In Maharashtra people buried their dead in urns under the floor of their houses in the north south direction, they did not use separate cemeteries like Harrapans.

- In south india dead body was placed in east-west direction.

- Terracotta figures of women suggest that chalcolithic people venerated the mother goddess.

- Both the settlement patterns and burial practices suggests the beginning of social inequalities.

* Ganeshwar- Jodhpura culture:

-  Ganeshwar, which is located close to the rich copper mines of the Sikar-Jhunjhunu area of the Khetri copper belt in Rajasthan.

- The copper objects excavated from this area include arrowheads, spearheads, fish hooks, colts, bangles, chisels, etc.

- Some of their shapes are similar to those discovered at Indus sites.

- A terracotta cake resembling the Indus type has been also found.

- It also shows many microliths, which are typical of the chalcolithic culture.

- OCP pottery has also been found painted in black.

-  Since the Ganeshwar deposits are ascribed to 2800-2200 BCE, they largely predate the mature Harappan culture.

- Ganeshwara supplied copper to Harappa and did not receive much from it.

- The Ganeshwar people largely lived on agriculture and hunting.

- Although their principal craft was the manufacture of copper objects, they could not develop urban elements of the Harappan economy.

- They can be regarded as pre Harrpan chalcolithic culture, they contributed the making of mature harrapan culture.

- Pre-Harappan strata on some sites in the Harappan zone are also called early Harappan in order to distinguish them from the mature urban Indus civilization.

- Thus, the pre-Harappan phase at Kalibangan in Rajasthan and Banawali in Haryana is distinctly chalcolithic. So is the case with Kot Diji in Sindh in Pakistan.


* OCP(Ochre coloured pottery) culture: 2000–1500 BCE (late Harappan / early Vedic period).

- Found mainly in the upper Ganga-Yamuna doab, parts of Haryana, Rajasthan, and western Uttar Pradesh.

- Associated with small-scale copper artifacts.

- The ocp people were junior contemporaries of the Harappans.

* Copper Hoard Culture: 2500–1500 BCE (mostly overlaps with OCP).

- Found in the Ganga-Yamuna doab, Chotanagpur plateau, Madhya Pradesh, and Rajasthan.

- No clear evidence of urbanization like the Harappan cities.

- Known for large copper objects such as anthropomorphic figures, swords, harpoons, and celts.

- Some sites are found with OCP pottery, suggesting a possible connection.

- Largest hoard comes from Gungeria in MP containing 424 copper tools and weapons.

* PGW culture

- In south India, they are found mostly in continuation of Neolithic settlements.

- The chalcolithic culture of the Vindhya region, Bihar and West Bengal are also not related to the Harappan culture.

- The chalcolithic cultures in central and western India disappeared by 1200 BCE 

- the Jorwe culture continued upto 700 BCE.

- Almost all chalcolithic communities used wheel-turned black-and-red pots, they were the first to use painted pottery.

- In eastern India, the chalcolithic phase was immediately followed, without any gap, by the iron phase.

- Bronze tools facilitated the rise of earliest civilizations in Crete , Egypt , Mesopotamia and indus.

- Chalcolithic people did not know the art of writing nor did they lived in cities.


----------------- Chapter 7 The Harappan Culture ----------------

- The Indus valley civilization is older than chalcolithic but far more advanced.

- It was discovered first in 1921 at the moderm site of Harappa situated in the province of West Punjab in Pakistan on the bank of ravi river.

- Many sites in Sind formed the central zone of the pre-Harappan culture.

- The Harappan culture covered parts of Punjab, Haryana, Sindh, Baluchistan, Gujarat, Rajasthan and the fringes of western Uttar Pradesh.

- It extended from Jammu in the north to the Narmada estuary in the south, and from the Makran coast of Baluchistan in the west of Meerut in the north-east.

- The area formed a triangle and accounted for about 12,99,600 square kilometres.

- Nearly 1500 Harappan sites are known so far in the subcontinent.

- Most of them are late Harappan, post-urban sites.

- Bhagwanpura(Haryana) lie on the banks of the Hakkar-Ghaggas channel.

- Only few can be regarded as cities.

- The two most important cities were Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro(means mound of dead).

- A third city lay at Chanhu-daro about 130 km south of Mohenjo-daro in Sindh, 

- a fourth city at Lothal in Gujarat at the head of the Gulf of Cambay.

- 5th city lay at Kalibangan situated in northern Rajasthan (Kalibangan means black bangles)

- 6th at Banawali is situated in Hissar district in Haryana.

- Sutkagendor and Surkotada were coastal cities marked by a citadel.

- Rangpur and Rojdi are harappan sites in the Kathiawar peninsula.

- Dholavira lying in the Kutch area of Gujarat shows Harappan fortification, water reservoir.

- Rakhigarhi is situated on the Ghaggar in Haryana and is much bigger than Dholavira.

- The sites of Amri and Kot Diji remain the evidence for early-Harappan stage.


* Town Planning and Structures

- Harappa and Mohenjo-daro each had its own citadel or acropolis, which was possibly occupied by members of the ruling class.

- Below the citadel in each city lay a lower town containing brick houses, which were inhabited by the common people.

- They followed the grid system. According to it, roads cut across one another almost at right angles, and the city was divided into so many blocks.

- Mohenjo-daro was extremely rich in structures.

- The great bath in Mohenjo-daro measures 11.88 x 7.01 metres and 2.43 metres deep.

- It is suggested that the Great Bath served ritual bathing.

- In Mohenjo-daro the largest building is a granary which is 45.71 metres long and 15.23 metres wide.

- But in the citadel of Harappa we find as many as six granaries.

- Harappa also shows two-roomed barracks, which possibly accommodated labourers.

- Granaries constituted an important part of the Harappan cities.

- The drainage system of Mohenjo-daro was very impressive.

- In Kalibangan many houses had their wells.

- The remains of streets and drains have also been found at Banawali.

 

* Agricultural Technologies

- The Harappan villages, mostly situated near the flood plains, produced sufficient foodgrains not only to feed themselves but also the town people.

- No hoe or ploughshare has been discovered, but the furrows has been discovered at Kalibangan(Pre harappan site).

- The Indus people produced wheat, barley, rai, peas, sesame, lentil, chickpea and mustard.

- They produced 2 types of wheat and barley.

- Millets are found from sites in Gujarat. Finds of rice are relatively rare.

- The people of Lothal used rice whose remains have been found   
                 
- Foodgrains were stored in granaries in Mohenjo-daro, Harappa and in Kalibangan.

- The Indus people were the earliest people to produce cotton.

- Because cotton was first produced in this area the Greeks called it sindon, which is derived from Sindh.

- Representations on seals and terracotta sculpture indicate that the bull was known.

- Terracotta models of the plough have been found at sites in Cholistan(Pakistan Punjab) and at Banawali.

- Evidence of a ploughed field at Kalibangan (Rajasthan) has been found.

- Traces of canals have been found at the Harappan site of Shortughai in Afghanistan, but not in Punjab or Sind.


* Domestication of Animals

- Oxen , buffaloes , sheeps , goats , cats , dogs, asses , camels and pigs were domesticated.

- The humped bulls were favoured by the Harappans.

- The remains of the horse are doubtful ,in any case the Harappan culture was not horse centred.

- Bones of wild species such as boar, deer and gharial are also found.

- Bones of fish and fowl are also found.

- The Harappan people in Gujarat produced rice and domesticated elephants.

* Technology and Crafts

- The Harappan culture belongs to the Bronze Age.

- The Harappans were very well acquainted with the manufacture and use of Bronze.

- Copper was obtained from the khetri copper mines of Rajasthan.

- Copper was also bough from Oman.

- Tin was possibly brought with difficulty from Afghanistan

- A piece of woven cotton has been recovered from mohenjo-daro.

- The Harappans also practised boat-making.

- Seal-making and terracotta manufacture were also important crafts.

- The goldsmiths made jewellery of silver, gold and precious stones.

- The Harappans were also experts in bead-making.

- Spindle whorls were used for spinning.


* Trade

-  Presence of numerous seals, uniform script and regulated weights and measures in a wide area has been found. 

- The Harappans carried on considerable trade in stone, metal, shell, etc.

- They did not use metal money. They carried on all exchanges through barter.

- They practised navigation on the coast of the Arabian Sea.

- They knew the use of wheel, they used modern 'ekka' but not spoked wheel.

- They had set up a trading colony in northern Afghanistan which evidently facilitated trade with Central Asia.

- Their cities also carried commerce with those in the land of the Tigris and the Euphrates.

- The Harappans carried on long distance trade in lapis lazuli; lapis may have contributed to the social prestige of the ruling class.
 
- Meluha was ancient name given to Indus region.

- Dilmun identified with Bahrain on the persian gulf.

- Mesopotamian text speaks of two intermediate trading stations Dilmun and makan between Mesopotamia and meluha .

- Parpola concluded that the language of Harappan people is Dravidian.
* Political Organization

- We have no clear idea about the political organization of the Harappans.

- No temples have been found at any Harappan site.

- Therefore it would be wrong to think that priests ruled in Harappa.

- We have no religious structures of any kind except the Great Bath.

- Harappa was possibly ruled by a class of merchants.

- It may be noted that the Harappans were lacking in weapons.

- Some archaeologists are of the opinion that Harappan society had no rulers, and that everybody enjoyed equal status.

* Religious Practices

- In Harappa numerous terracotta figurines of women have been found.

- The Harappans, looked upon the earth as a fertility goddess and worshipped her in the same manner as the Egyptians worshipped the Nile goddess Isis.

- Egyptians were matriarchal people , daughter inherited property.

- The Male Deity in the Indus Valley is represented on a seal. This god has three homed heads.

- He is represented in the sitting posture of a yogi, placing one foot on the other.

- This god is surrounded by an elephant, a tiger, a rhinoceros, and has a buffalo below his throne. At his feet appear two deer.

- The depicted god is identified as Pashupati Mahadeva.

- . The chief female deity was the Mother Goddess represented in terracotta figurines.
- Numerous symbols of the phallus and female sex organs made of stone have been found.

* Tree and Animal Worship

- The people of the Indus region also worshipped trees.

- The picture of a deity is repreented on a seal in the midst of the branches of the pipal.

- Animals were also worshipped in Harappan times.

- The most important of them is the one horned animal unicorn which may be identified with the rhinoceros. 

-Next in importance is the humped bull.

- Amulets have been found in large numbers.

- Probably the Harappans believed that ghosts and evil forces were capable of harming them. 

* The Harappan Script ( discovered by 1923)

- The Harappans invented the art of writing.

- Their script has not been deciphered so far, There are nearly 4000 specimens of Harappan writing on stone seals and other objects

- Unlike the Egyptians and Mesopotamians, the Harappans did not write long inscriptions

- Most inscriptions were recorded on seals, and contain only a few words.

- Altogether we have about 250 to 400 pictographs, and in the form of a picture each letter stands for some sound, idea or object.

- The Harappan script is not alphabetical but mainly pictographic.

- It is the indigenous product of the Indus region, and does not show any connection with scripts of western Asia.

- The script was mostly written from right to left.

- In a few long seals the boustrophedon method – writing in the reverse direction in alternative lines - was adopted.

* Weights and Measures

- The urban people of the Indus region  used weights and measurement for trade and other transactions.

- Numerous articles used for weights have been found.

- They show that in weighing mostily 16 or its multiples were used; for instance, 16, 64, 160, 320, and 640.

- The Harappans also knew the art of measurement.

- Measure sticks made up of bronze has been found.

* Craft Production

- Chanhudaro is a tiny settlement, almost exclusively devoted to craft production, including bead-making, shell-cutting, metal-working, seal-making and weight-making.

-The variety of materials were used to make beads.

- stones like carnelian (of a beautiful red colour), jasper, crystal, quartz and steatite; metals like copper, bronze and gold; and shell, faience and terracotta or burnt clay.

- Nageshwar(Gujarat) and Balakot(Balochistan) both settlements are near the coast. These were specialized centres for making shell objects, including bangles, ladles and inlay.

- The Harappans established settlements such as Nageshwar and Balakot in areas where shell was available.

- Shortughai, in far-off Afghanistan, near the best source of lapis lazuli, a blue stone that was apparently very highly valued.

- Lothal was situated near the sources of carnelian (from Bharuch in Gujarat), steatite (from south Rajasthan and north Gujarat) and metal (from Rajasthan).

- The greatest artistic creations of the Harappan culture are the seals.

- About 2,000 seals have been found, and of these a great majority carry short inscriptions with pictures of the one-homed bull, the buffalo, the tiger, the rhinoceros, the goat and the elephant.

- A woman dancer made of bronze is the best specimen.

- The Harappan culture is poor in artistic works made of stone.

- The Harappans were great experts in the use of potter's wheels.

* Burials

- At burials in Harappan sites the dead were generally laid in pits.

- At Lothal the burial pit was lined with burnt bricks indicating the use of coffins.

- There is no clear evidence for the practice of Sati.

- Some graves contain pottery and ornaments, perhaps indicating a belief that these could be used in the afterlife.

- Jwellery has been found in burials of both men and women.

- In some instances the dead were buried with copper mirrors.

- But on the whole, it appears that the Harappans did not believe in burying precious things with the dead.  

* Origin , Maturity and End

- The mature harappan culture mainly existed between 2550 BCE to 1900 BCE.

- By 1900 BCE two important cities of Harappan culture Harappa and Mohenjodaro seems to have disappeared.

- Other sites faded gradually and continued in its degenerated phase in outlying fringes of Gujarat, rajasthan , Haryana and western UP.

- The post-urban phase of the Harappan culture also known as Late harappan culture cover the period 1900 to 1200 BCE.

- The late Harappan cultures are primarily chalcolithic in which tools of stone and copper are used.

- Places such as Prabhas Patan in somnath and Rangpur in gujarat are direct descendents of Harappan culture.

- Swat valley can be regarded as northernmost outpost of late harappan culture.

- Ragi or finger millet is not found at any harappan site.

* IVC sites 
Pakstan - Mohenjodaro(Sindh), Harappa(Punjab ) ,Ganweriwala(Punjab) , Chanhudaro , Kot Diji ,Suktagendor


Gujarat - Dholavira , Lothal ,Surkotada , Prabhas patan(Late Harappan), Rangpur(Late Harappan)

Haryana - Rakhigarhi ,Banawali

Up- Hulas and Alamgirpur(Weternmost site of IVC), both late harappan

Rajasthan - Kalibangan , Sanghol(Late Harappan)

J&K - Manda(Late harappan)

* Collapse of Harappan

- During the later phase of the Harappan culture some exotic tools and pottery indicate the slow percolation of new people in the Indus basin.

- A few signs of insecurity and violence appear in the last phase of Mohenjo-daro.

- Hoards of jewellery were buried at places, and skulls were huddled together at one place.

- At several sites in Punjab and Haryana, Grey Ware and Painted Grey Ware, generally associated with Vedic people, have been found in conjunction with some late Harappan pottery dated around 1200 B.C.

- All this can be attributed to the barbarian horse-riding people (i.e. Aryans).

***************** JAINISM AND BUDDHISM  **********************

- The 6th century BCE is considered a wonderful century in history.

- Great thinkers like Buddha, Mahavira, Heraclitus, Zoroaster, Confucius and Lao Tse lived and preached their ideas in this century.

- There was rise of heterodox sects against the orthodox religion dominated by rites and rituals.

- Among them the most successful were Jainism and Buddhism whose impact on the Indian society was remarkable.

* Causes for the Rise of Jainism and Buddhism
- The primary cause for the rise of Jainism and Buddhism was the religious unrest in India in the 6th century B.C.

- The complex rituals and sacrifices advocated in the Later Vedic period were not acceptable to the common people. 

- The sacrificial ceremonies were also found to be too expensive. 

- The superstitious beliefs and mantras confused the people.

- The teachings of Upanishads, an alternative to the system of sacrifices, were highly philosophical in nature and not easily understandable by people.

- Therefore what was needed for larger interest of people was simple, tangible, practical ways of attaining salvation.

- This need was fulfilled by the teachings of Buddha and Mahavira.

- Other than the religious factor, social and economic factors also contributed to the rise of these two religions.

- The rigid caste system prevalent in India generated tensions in the society.

- The Kshatriyas had resented the domination of the priestly class.

- Both Buddha and Mahavira belonged to Kshatriya origin.

- The growth of trade led to the improvement in the economic conditions of the Vaisyas.

- As a result, they wanted to enhance their social status but the orthodox Varna system did not allow this. 

- Therefore, they began to extend support to Buddhism and Jainism. It was this merchant class that extended the chief support to these new religions.

* Jainism

- Life of Vardhamana Mahavira (539- 467 B.C.) : Vardhamana Mahavira was the 24th Tirthankara of the Jain tradition.

- He was born at Kundagrama near Vaisali to Kshatriya parents Siddhartha and Trisala.

- He married Yasoda and gave birth to a daughter.

- At the age of 30 he became an ascetic and wandered for twelve years.

- In the 13th year of his penance, he attained the highest spiritual knowledge called Kevala Gnana.

- Thereafter, he was called Mahavira and Jina. His followers were called Jains and his religion Jainism.

- He preached his doctrines for 30 years and died at the age of 72 at Pava near Rajagriha.

- The 3 principles of Jainism, also known as Triratnas  are:

i) right faith : belief in the teachings and wisdom of Mahavira.

ii) right knowledge : acceptance of the theory that there is no God and that the world has been existing without a creator and that all objects possess a soul.

iii) right conduct.
 - not to injure life
 - not to lie
 - not to steal
 - not to acquire property
 - not to lead immoral life.

- Mahavira regarded all objects, both animate and inanimate, have souls and various degrees of consciousness.

- Mahavira rejected the authority of the Vedas and objected to the Vedic rituals.

- Even the practice of agriculture was considered sinful as it causes injury to the earth, worms and animals.

- Similarly the doctrine of asceticism and renunciation was also carried to extreme lengths by the practice of starvation, nudity and other forms of self-torture.

* Spread of Jainism

- Mahavira organised the Sangha to spread his teachings.

- He admitted both men and women in the Sangha, which consisted of both monks and lay followers.

- It spread rapidly in Western India and Karnataka.

- Chandragupta Maurya, Kharavela of Kalinga and the royal dynasties of south India such as the Gangas, the Kadambas, the Chalukyas and the Rashtrakutas patronized Jainism.

- By the end of the 4th century B.C.E there was a serious famine in the Ganges valley. Many Jain monks led by Bhadrabagu and Chandragupta Maurya came to Sravana Belgola in Karnataka.

- Those who stayed back in north India were led by a monk named 'Sthulabahu' who changed the code of conduct for the monks.

- This led to the division of Jainism into two sects Svetambaras (whiteclad) and Digambaras (Sky-clad or Naked).

- The 1st Jain Council was convened at Pataliputra by Sthulabahu, the leader of the Digambaras, in the beginning of the 3rd century B.C.E.

- The 2nd Jain Council was held at Valabhi in 5th century A.D.

- The final compilation of Jain literature called 12 Angas was completed in this council.

* Buddhism 
 Gautam Buddha (567- 487 B.C.E.): Gautama or Siddhartha, the founder of Buddhism, was born in 567 B.C.E. in Lumbini Garden near Kapilavastu.

- Symbol of birth is Lotus and Bull 

- His father was  of the Sakya clan .

- As his mother died at child birth, he was brought up by his aunt Prajapati Gautami.

- At last, he sat under a bodhi tree at Bodh Gaya and did intense penance, after which he got Enlightenment (Nirvana) at the age of 35 .

- He delivered his first sermon at Sarnath (Dhammachakra pravartan) near Benares and for the next  45 years he led the life of a preacher.

- The most important disciples of Buddha were Sariputta, Moggallanna, Ananda, Kassapa and Upali.

- Kings like Prasenajit of Kosala and Bimbisara and Ajatasatru of Magadha accepted his doctrines and became his disciples.

- Buddha neither accepts god nor rejects the existence of god. He laid great emphasis on the law of karma.

- Though he did not make a direct attack on the caste system, he was against any social distinctions and threw open his order to all.

- Therefore, Buddhism was more a social than religious revolution.

- Buddha had two kinds of disciples – monks (bhikshus) and lay worshippers (upasikas).

- Sariputta, Moggallana and Ananda were some of the famous monks.

- Magadha, Kosala, Kausambi and several republican states of North India embraced this religion.

- About 200 years after the death of Buddha, the famous Mauryan Emperor Asoka embraced Buddhism.

- Through his missionary effort Asoka spread Buddhism into West Asia and Ceylon. Thus a local religious sect was transformed into a world religion.

- Abhidhamma Pitaka - philosophy of Buddhism

- Vinay and Sutta were compiled at 1st Buddhist council.

- Abhidhamma was compiled at 3 rd Buddhist council.

* Causes for the Decline of Buddhism in India

- The revival of Brahmanism and the rise of Bhagavatism led to the fall of popularity of Buddhism.

- The use of Pali, the language of the masses as the language of Buddhism was given up from the 1st century A.D.

- The Buddhists began to adopt Sanskrit, the language of the elite.

- After the birth of Mahayana Buddhism, the practice of idol worship and making offerings led to the deterioration of moral standards and other lex practices started.

- Moreover, the attack of the Huns in 5th and 6th centuries and the Turkish invaders in 12th century destroyed the monasteries.

All these factors contributed to the decline of Buddhism in India.


* Contribution of Buddhism to Indian Culture

- The concept of ahimsa was its chief contribution. Later, it became one of the cherished values of our nation.

- Its contribution to the art and architecture of India was notable.

- The stupas at Sanchi, Bharhut and Gaya are wonderful pieces of architecture.

- Thus when Ahmad Shah Abdali invaded India, it became the responsibility of the Marathas to protect India.

- The Marathas fought very bravely against Ahmad Shah Abdali in the 3rd Battle of Panipat in 1761. But they got defeated.

- Many Maratha leaders thousands of soldiers died in this battle. Balaji Baji Rao also died on hearing the sad end of this battle.

- Also, this battle gave a death blow to the Maratha power. Thereafter, the Maratha confederacy weakened due to internal conflicts among the Maratha chiefs. 

- After the decline of the Mughal Empire, the Marathas emerged a great power in India but they could not succeed in preventing the establishment of British power in India. 

-The important causes for the downfall were that there was lack of unity among the Maratha chiefs like Holkar, Scindia and Bhonsle.

- Also, the superiority of the British army and fighting methods ultimately won.
