- After this thorough scrutiny & amendment (if any), the Bill is sent back to House.

* Bill in the Second House :

- The Bill goes through the same three stages of First, Second & Third Reading in the second House as well.

- The House has four alternatives :
i) May pass the Bill without amendments.
ii) May the Bill with amendments and send it to first house for reconsideration.
iii) May reject the Bill.
iv) May not take any action and thus keep the Bill pending.

- the imposition of fines or other pecuniary penalties.
- the demand or payment of fees for services rendered.
- the imposition, Abolition, Remission, alteration or regulation of any tax by any local authority or body for local purposes.

- The Speaker’s decision on the question of whether a Bill is a Money Bill or not is final. It cannot be questioned in a court of law, not even by the president.

* Legislative Procedure for Money Bill.

- A Money Bill can be introduced only in Lok Sabha and that too with prior permission of President.

- A Money Bill cannot be introduced by a private member, only by minister, so its public bill.

- After the Money Bill is passed by Lok Sabha, it is transmitted to Rajya Sabha.

- Rajya Sabha has restricted powers in respect to Money Bill :

- RS cannot reject or amend a Money Bill. It can only make recommendations.

- RS must return Bill with or without recommendations to LS within 14 days, failing which the Bill is deemed as passed by both Houses.

- When a Bill is returned to LS, it can reject all recommendations or accept them.

- If accepted then amended bill is deemed as passed by both houses, if rejected then the orignal bill is deemed to be passed by both the house.

- Finally when it comes at President, he may either give his assent or withhold it. President cannot return Bill for reconsideration.

- Thus Lok sabha has more powers in regard to money bills while for ordinary bills both the houses have equal powers.
