       ********************* Chapter 6- Weavers, Iron Smelters ,and Factory owners ***********

- When  iron and steel industry started growing from the 1850s, Britain came to be known as the “workshop of the world”

- With the growth of industrial production, British industrialists began to see India as a vast market for their industrial products, and over time manufactured goods from Britain began flooding India.

- Around 1750, before the British conquered Bengal, India was by far the world’s largest producer of cotton textiles.

- Indian textiles were were extensively traded in Southeast Asia (Java, Sumatra and Penang) and West and Central Asia.

- Patola was woven in Surat, Ahmedabad and Patan. Highly valued in Indonesia, it became part of the local weaving tradition there.

- European traders first encountered fine cotton cloth from India carried by Arab merchants in Mosul in present-day Iraq. So they began referring to all finely
woven textiles as “muslin”.

- Portuguese called cotton textiles 'Calico' derived from Calicut.

- Jamdani is a fine muslin on which decorative motifs are woven on the loom, typically in grey and white.

- Often mixture of cotton and gold thread was used.

- Most important centres of jamdani weaving was Dacca in Bengal and lucknow in united provinces.

- Dacca(Dhaka) was famous for mulmul and jamdani weaving.

-  printed cotton cloths called chintz, cossaes (or khassa) and bandanna. Bandanna patterns were mostly produced in Rajasthan and Gujarat.

- By the early 18th century, worried by the popularity of Indian textiles, wool and silk makers in England began protesting against the import of Indian cotton textiles.
- In 1720, the British government enacted a legislation banning the use of printed cotton textiles – chintz – in England. This Act was known as the Calico Act.

- In 1764, the spinning jenny was invented by John Kaye which increased the productivity of the traditional spindles

- By the late 19th century, however, the craft of iron smelting was in decline. In most villages, furnaces fell into disuse and the amount of iron produced came down.

-  By the late 19th century iron and steel was being imported from Britain. Ironsmiths in India began using the imported iron to manufacture utensils and implements.

- The Slave Revolt in St Domingue, August 1791, In the 18th century, French planters produced indigo and sugar in the French colony of St Domingue in the Caribbean
islands. 

-The African slaves who worked on the plantations rose in rebellion in 1791, burning the plantations and killing their rich  planters. In 1792 France abolished
slavery in the French colonies. These events led to the collapse of the indigo plantations on the Caribbean islands.

How first world war affected British Rule in India? First world war changed political and economic situations in india. Economic crisis , inflation due to rising expenditure of military by britishers led to increased taxes over Indians. Many peasants and leaders resented due to that. Many industrialist benefitted greatly due to this , as import from Britain reduced they had to be dependent on local production in india, many companies like TISCO, jute companies benefitted as demand for leather ,jute , rails increase manifold.

- Britishers needed large supply of soldiers from Indian villages for alien cause Indian soldiers after coming from war understood the oppressions of imperialist power on asia and Africa and they wanted to get free from colonial rule. In 1917 there was peasant and worker revolt in Russia these inspired socialist ideas of leaders and common peoples in india. Thus in many ways world war from 1914- 1918 had lasting effect on india's struggle for independence.
